    <h1>Alex Kartman</h1>
    <p><em>Seeking Entry-Level Python developer position</em></p>
    <p>Professional Summary
        I've been interested in computers since I was 6 years old. It all started with the ZX Spectum.
        During my school years I tried to learn programming and 3D graphics. Life plays by its own
        rules, but I always tried to stick to work where there is technology. Now I am finally
        starting to play by my own rules. And I'm breaking into IT.</p>
